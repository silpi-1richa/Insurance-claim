import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Step 1: Load accident data
accident_data = pd.read_csv("accident_data.csv")

# Step 2: Data preprocessing
# Perform data cleaning, handle missing values, and transform data as needed

# Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Analyze accident patterns, high-risk locations, and contributing factors through descriptive statistics and visualizations
# Example EDA:
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.countplot(x='weather_condition', data=accident_data)
plt.title('Distribution of Accidents by Weather Condition')
plt.xlabel('Weather Condition')
plt.ylabel('Number of Accidents')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()

# Step 4: Predictive modeling
# Build predictive models using machine learning algorithms to forecast high-risk locations and potential accidents

# Step 5: Geospatial visualization
# Use geospatial visualization libraries (e.g., Folium) to map accident hotspots and visualize spatial patterns

# Step 6: Real-time monitoring
# Develop a real-time monitoring system to detect anomalies and emerging risk factors from incoming data streams

# Step 7: Community engagement
# Collaborate with local communities, law enforcement agencies, and transportation authorities to gather insights and implement community-driven solutions

# Step 8: Scalability and adaptability
# Design the system to be scalable and adaptable to evolving needs and technological advancements

# Step 9: Ethical considerations
# Ensure compliance with ethical guidelines, privacy protection, and data security measures throughout the development and implementation process
